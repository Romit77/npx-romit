# 🚀 Romit's Terminal Portfolio

> _"Why have a boring resume when you can have an interactive CLI experience?"_

Hey there! I'm **Romit Dey**, and I got tired of sending static PDFs as portfolios. So I built this interactive command-line experience to showcase who I am, what I've built, and why you should probably hire me (or at least grab a coffee with me ☕).

## ✨ What Makes This Cool?

🎨 **ASCII Art That Actually Looks Good** - No more boring terminal outputs  
🚀 **Real Projects, Real Impact** - From surveillance apps serving 5K+ users to blockchain solutions  
🏆 **Hackathon Winner Vibes** - Because who doesn't love a good competition story?  
⚡ **Modern Tech Stack** - Built with the same tools I use professionally  
🎯 **WASD Navigation** - Because arrow keys are for normies  
💫 **Smooth Animations** - Terminal apps can be beautiful too

### 🛠️ Projects You'll Discover:

- **Evencio** 🎉 - Event management platform with AI-powered features (because manual work is so 2023)
- **TresorX** 💰 - Solana blockchain app for token management (riding the Web3 wave)
- **Multiple Award-Winning Projects** 🏆 - From 300+ team competitions to top 10 finishes

## 🤔 Why I Built This

Let's be honest - regular portfolios are boring. I wanted to create something that:

1. **Actually shows my skills** instead of just listing them
2. **Tells a story** through interactive exploration
3. **Stands out** in a world of cookie-cutter resumes
4. **Demonstrates my personality** (I like building cool stuff!)

## 🎁 Want to Build Your Own?

Feel free to fork this and make it yours! Here's how:

1. Clone the repo
2. Update the projects, skills, and personal info in `index.js`
3. Change the package name in `package.json`
4. Publish to npm with `npm publish`
5. Now you have your own `npx yourname` command!

## 🚀 Pro Tips

- Use **WASD** or arrow keys to navigate
- Explore every section - there are easter eggs!
- Try the project details for the full story
- The experience section has all my achievements
