# 🚀 Romit's Terminal Portfolio + CLI Portfolio Generator

> _"Why have a boring resume when you can have an interactive CLI experience?"_

Hey there! I'm **Romit Dey**, and I got tired of sending static PDFs as portfolios. So I built this interactive command-line experience to showcase who I am, what I've built, and why you should probably hire me (or at least grab a coffee with me ☕).

**But wait, there's more!** 🎉 I've also created a **CLI Portfolio Generator** so YOU can create your own awesome terminal portfolio in minutes!

## ✨ What Makes This Cool?

🎨 **ASCII Art That Actually Looks Good** - No more boring terminal outputs  
🚀 **Real Projects, Real Impact** - From surveillance apps serving 5K+ users to blockchain solutions  
🏆 **Hackathon Winner Vibes** - Because who doesn't love a good competition story?  
⚡ **Modern Tech Stack** - Built with the same tools I use professionally  
🎯 **WASD Navigation** - Because arrow keys are for normies  
💫 **Smooth Animations** - Terminal apps can be beautiful too

## 🎮 Quick Start

### Experience My Portfolio:

```bash
npx romit77

### Create Your Own CLI Portfolio:

## 🤔 Why I Built This

Let's be honest - regular portfolios are boring. I wanted to create something that:

1. **Actually shows my skills** instead of just listing them
2. **Tells a story** through interactive exploration
3. **Stands out** in a world of cookie-cutter resumes
4. **Demonstrates my personality** (I like building cool stuff!)

## � Create Your Own CLI Portfolio

Want to make your own CLI portfolio? I've got you covered! The generator will:

1. **Ask you questions** about your background, projects, and skills
2. **Generate ASCII art** from your name
3. **Create a complete npm package** ready to publish
4. **Give you a custom command** like `npx your-name-portfolio`

### Step-by-Step Guide:

```bash
# Step 1: Generate your portfolio
npx romit77 create-cli-portfolio

# Step 2: Navigate to your new portfolio
cd my-cli-portfolio

# Step 3: Install dependencies
npm install

# Step 4: Test it locally
npm start

# Step 5: Publish to npm (make sure you're logged in)
npm login
npm publish

# Step 6: Share with the world!
# Now anyone can run: npx your-username-portfolio
```

### What Gets Generated:

- 📄 **portfolio.js** - Your interactive CLI application
- 📦 **package.json** - Ready for npm publishing
